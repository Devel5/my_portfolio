        <p>My journey as a developer started very young when I started coding at the age of 17. I was studying programming as a subject in my school since I took the computer science group. I didn't like programming much then since I couldn't figure out where the error was. Then when I was doing my masters, I happened to help my friend who had issue with visualizsing his project which was to build an app in android, that can take pictures, store the picture, time and location it is was taken. That's when I started working with the programming. We all use various apps on the phone, I started coding in XML, which gave the outer look although when I started coding in Java script I couldn't proceed and had to drop it. Even after that I kept looking for jobs with coding and tried to study by myself. Since I was doing a full-time job, I couldn't do much. That's when my company offered the scholarship program, so that I could study in coder Academy and learn about Ruby, HTML, CSS, Java script and it goes on.. I have successfully completed the course and am working on individual projects (out of interest).I would like to work on more projects and learn more. If you are interested in my profile, contact me!!  </p>
