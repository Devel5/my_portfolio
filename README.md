Design Process: 
I created css and html files for three pages: Home, about and contact.
Whatever be the content for that page will be in html file and whatever be the styling will be in css. I believed that it made the files look less messy.
Then I desgined the navbar, container and footer for one page used the samething for the rest, Since they look same in all three pages. It is only the content of the container that was different in each page. 
In home I have a resume video, contact page I have an interactive form and in about page I have a description about me.
Project plan and time line:
I started designing the Basic Idea using pen and paper. Then gave it a little more flair using Figma, wireframes in figma gave me a clear idea as to how to design.
