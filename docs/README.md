Github Repository link - My repository is public. Link to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Devel5/my_portfolio

Purpose: Purpose of my portfolio is to give a visual resume not to mention the first hand experience of my knowledge and experience with HTML and CSS for my potential employers.
Features: my portfolio has an interactive, responsive Navbar, Video resume, ABout me: Describing how I started coding and finally in the contact me page I form which th eemployers can fill inorder to reach me or they reach me through my linkedin profile, check my github,facebook or twitter profile.

Design Process: 
I created css and html files for three pages: Home, about and contact.
Whatever be the content for that page will be in html file and whatever be the styling will be in css. I believed that it made the files look less messy.
Then I desgined the navbar, container and footer for one page used the samething for the rest, Since they look same in all three pages. It is only the content of the container that was different in each page. 
In home I have a resume video, contact page I have an interactive form and in about page I have a description about me.
Project plan and time line:
I started designing the Basic Idea using pen and paper. Then gave it a little more flair using Figma, wireframes in figma gave me a clear idea as to how to design.

1) Key events in the development of internet from 1980s till today:

      During the 1980s, networks were widely deployed, initially to support scientific research. As their potential to improve personal communications and collaboration became apparent, additional academic disciplines and industry began to use the technology.
      1983: Domain name system is proposed. Creation of suffixes such as ".com," ".gov" and ".edu" comes a year later.
      1988: One of the first Internet worms, Morris, cripples thousands of computers.
      1990: Tim Berners-Lee creates the World Wide Web while developing ways to control computers remotely at CERN, the             European Organization for Nuclear Research.
      1993: Marc Andreessen and colleagues at University of Illinois create Mosaic, the first Web browser to combine graphics and text on a single page, opening the Web to the world with software that is easy to use.
      1995: Amazon.com Inc. opens its virtual doors.
      2002: World Internet population surpasses 500 million.
      2004: Mark Zuckerberg starts Facebook as a sophomore at Harvard University.
      2005: Launch of YouTube video-sharing site.
      2006: World Internet population surpasses 1 billion.
      2007: Apple Inc. releases iPhone, introducing millions more to wireless Internet access.
      2012: Raspberry Pi, a bare-bones, low-cost credit-card sized computer created by volunteers mostly drawn from academia and the UK tech industry, is released to help teach children to code.
      2013: Apple releases the first Retina Display MacBook Pros. Sony releases the PlayStation 4 in the United States.Microsoft releases Xbox One.

      2) Relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet: Domain, webserver, DNS and web browser.
      Domain:
      A domain name is the unique url for accessing your server data. Domain name format is name.tld . .tld is a repository registered with ICAN. ICAN is the international organisation for managing domain names.
      
       In short, Domain is like contact name and server is the mobile phone. Every server would have a reachable IP address (phone number) and as humans are better at memorizing names than numbers, That's where DNS comes:
      
      DNS â€“ Domain Name System:
DNS is the glue that makes the web work. It translates a name (www.google.com) to an IP address that tells which web server is hosting the website. It also tells other email servers where to send email for a domain name using what is called the MX record.
      Server:
      A Server is the any computer machine which has a static Ip address and it can be accessible through that Ip address.
      A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. "Hosting" means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available on that computer. The web server will send any web page from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request. 
      Web browser:
      The main purpose of the web browser is to locate the content on the world wide web and display in the shape of web page, image, audio and video form. It can be called a client server because it contacts the web server for desired information. 


 3) One aspect of development of the internet technology and how it has contributed to the world today:
      Internet has revolutionised communication, so much that now internet has become the preferred mode of communication. This includes but not limited too, applyiong for a jpob online, ordering food online, booking a ride online, sharing a moment with a friend, video calling with family and so on. Before the Internet, if we wanted to keep up with the news, you had to walk down to the newsstand when it opened in the morning and buy a local edition reporting what had happened the previous day. But today a click or two is enough to read your local paper and any news source from anywhere in the world, updated up to the minute.
      In the past one could turn off digital communication: Like tv and radio but now a day, smart phones have become a part of our lives. We call it smart phone since it can access internet and gives us the required information. We wake up check the weather and then plan the day. We feel connected to the universe only when we have internet else even if there are so many people around us, we feel like we are alone.
      Internet has most certainly changed our lives. Communicating with a friend over WhatsApp or other internet messaging system is a lot easier and distance is not an issue anymore.
